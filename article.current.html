  <p class="description">What I'm doing currently.</p>
  <div>
    <article id="content">
      <p>We have recently entered the second national lock down in the UK due to the increase threat of Coronavirus.</p>

      <p>I am actively perfecting my <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank">C#</a> by adding understanding of relevant frameworks and building <a href="projects.html">projects</a> to display <a href="skills.pdf">my skills</a> on this website. I am also in the middle of finishing up my novel I have been writing for probably 3 years now, it’s a book about my father which will be released in 2021.</p>
      
      <p>One of the positive results of the lockdown is that it has afforded me more opportunities to spend real quality time with my now 10 month old son, who was born right at the beginning of what we know as the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>
      
      <p>The sudden end to my previous career has got me to think more critically about my future and the impact Coronavirus will have on the world for the foreseeable future. As such, here are some of my thought about my future:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting">Telecommuting</a></strong>: Working from home has been a game changer, having eliminated my 2-3 hour commute during rush hour. My mental and physical health feel much improved and productivity has therefore also increased. One of the reason in why I decided to make the transition into software & web development was the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting">WFH</a>, now the question stands, how long will this last?</p></li>
      
      <li><p><strong>Continuous Learning</strong>: This is something I have had to embrace coming into the IT world. The lifelong commitment to learning is important to keep up with the new technological improvements. I have never enjoyed formal education but once I delved into the world of self taught learning, I found myself excel tremendously due to the fact that I was able to select the right teachers that taught in the way I learned best. I am currently learning to perfect my <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> knowledge.</p></li>
      
      <li><p><strong>Building</strong>: I am focusing on developing websites for my portfolio to showcase my software development skills, web design and programming. I had previously set up a brand management company, <a href="https://www.mayungaent.com/bxzqn">BXZQN</a> where we offer brand equity solutions, one being web development.</p></li>
      
      <li><p><strong>Savings</strong>: This pandemic has really put a focus on having a substantial saving account as you never know what the future holds. I have developed a system that would increase my savings substantially as well as build a personal saving for my son so that when he becomes of age, he will have a fund that he can use to start his life.</p></li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <p>What does the future hold, who knows, but "to fail to plan is planning to fail". - Benjamin Franklin</p>
